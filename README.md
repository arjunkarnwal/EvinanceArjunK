# EvinanceArjunK

1) Implemented the End to End Solution of the assignment.
2) Constuctor of AsyncLogger is changed.
3) EvinanceApp.Java provide end to end functioanlity of logger. This gives a wholesome view of the solution implemented.
4) Two appender have been implemented -> First one to print log on file and second one to print on console.
5) A centralized Queue Dispatcher is implemented that act as a crux of application. It hadle picking up log message to be later handled by Message Processor and Appenders. This is threaded process.
6) Unit tests have also been implemented.
7) Logs are printed in order of their generation.
8) Implementation of AsyncLogger is non blocking
9) All 6 requirements have been implemented.
10) The design of the solution is such that we can add any number of appender without chaging the application. Also we can implement different Loggers.
